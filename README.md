## üìñ Overview
The project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using soil images to classify them into different categories. It helps automate soil analysis by providing a visual classification tool for agricultural and environmental applications.

---

## üóÇ Dataset
- The dataset consists of soil images belonging to various classes.
- Classes may include: **Red Soil, Alluvial Soil, Sandy Soil, Black Soil**, etc.
- You can replace or expand the dataset using your own labeled images.
> üî∏ *Note:* Dataset loading and preprocessing steps are included in the notebook.

---

## üß† Model Architecture
- The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Key components:
  - Convolutional layers for feature extraction
  - MaxPooling for down-sampling
  - Dropout for regularization
  - Dense layers for classification
- Performance metrics such as **accuracy and loss** are visualized during training.
