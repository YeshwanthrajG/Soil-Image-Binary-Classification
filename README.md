## 📖 Overview
The project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using soil images to classify them into different categories. It helps automate soil analysis by providing a visual classification tool for agricultural and environmental applications.

---

## 🗂 Dataset
- The dataset consists of soil images belonging to various classes.
- Classes may include: **Red Soil, Alluvial Soil, Sandy Soil, Black Soil**, etc.
- You can replace or expand the dataset using your own labeled images.
> 🔸 *Note:* Dataset loading and preprocessing steps are included in the notebook.

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Key components:
  - Convolutional layers for feature extraction
  - MaxPooling for down-sampling
  - Dropout for regularization
  - Dense layers for classification
- Performance metrics such as **accuracy and loss** are visualized during training.

---

## How to Use
1. Prepare your dataset: organize images in train/ and test/ folders, each containing subfolders for each soil class.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook using the following command:

jupyter notebook soil-classification2.ipynb

3. Follow the notebook cells to:

* Load and preprocess data

* Train the CNN

* Evaluate and visualize results

---

## 📊 Results
Model performance is evaluated using:

* Training and validation accuracy

* Confusion matrix

* Sample predictions

---

## 🔮 Future Work
* Improve model accuracy using data augmentation

* Integrate with mobile apps or IoT systems

* Deploy the model using a web app (e.g., Flask or Streamlit)
